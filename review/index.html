    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p>Omori is a game that has changed my concept on what makes a good story. Omori takes you through the <strong>struggles of owning up to your mistakes</strong>, or just leaving them behind. This 20-hour journey will have you laughing and by the time you reach the credits. 
        Omori contains several ending paths that depend on how you interact through out the story. This is a game that should not be looked over.</p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
    <h2>Combat</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>The combat of Omori is all based on human emotions. They range from sadness, anger, and happiness. The enemies and players can all have a change in emotion during combat, which can alter how much damage they receive or take. 
        It is like Pokémon types and how they counteract each other in battle.</p>
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
    <h3>Basil</h3>
    <p>Basil is one of the more prominent characters in the story, and he is the character you are searching for throughout the game. Basil has a fascination with gardening and flowers. He compares every main character to a certain type of plant, 
        reflecting on their interests and quirks.</p>
    <p>
         <q>maybe one day… things can go back to the way they were before.</q>
